    \section{Reduced order modelling}
    
\begin{itemize}
\item The DE based niching algorithm is not tested for the higher dimension
problem, resulting in reconsider to reduce the problem dimension. 
\item The preferred way to carry out the dimension reduction is by finding principal components called as principal component analysis.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1mm}
Following are the steps to carry out the PCA.
\begin{itemize}
    
\item Step 1: Finding the error vector of each wing:
    The error from the nominal geometry is given as,
$$x_{i, j}^{\prime}=\hat{x}_{i, j}-x_{i}^{0}$$
where, $x_{i}^{0}$ is the baseline coordinates (NACA0012) and $\hat{x}_{i, j}$ coordinates of given wing.
\item Step 2: Finding centered error vector$\tilde{x}_{i, j}$:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{x}_{i, j}=x_{i, j}^{\prime}-\bar{x}_{i} \mid i=1, \ldots, p ; j=1, \ldots, n
\end{equation}

where, the mean of these error vectors is calculated as follows.
\begin{equation}
\bar{x}_{i}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{i, j}^{\prime}, i=1, \ldots, p
\end{equation}

\item Step 3: Singular value decomposition (SVD):
\begin{equation}
\tilde{X}=M \Sigma N^{T}
\end{equation}

Here, M, N are $mp \times mp$, $n \times n$ orthonormal matrix respectively. And, $\Sigma$ is $mp \times n$ is a diagonal entries ordered in decreasing value. 
\end{itemize}
Based on the leading $\Sigma$ values, the dimension of the problem is decided.sss
