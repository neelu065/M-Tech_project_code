\begin{itemize}
\item Nadarajah\cite{Nadarajah} compares three different \textbf{parameterization schemes}: B-splines, CST method, and Mesh-point for airfoil geometry.
\item In this work, extended version of B-spline called the FFD technique is implemented.
\item The author D.J Poole\cite{Poole3} introduced a total of 18 benchmark functions to test the DE-based niching method. 
\item Niching methods based on \textbf{neighbourhood search} show better results in terms of quick convergence and reliability of stable niches.
\item For any ASO problems, the crucial steps involved are a choice of parameterization technique, selection of optimizer, and the optional step involving dimensional reduction method.
\end{itemize}
Introduction on these steps are discussed in the upcoming slides.
