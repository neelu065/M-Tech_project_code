 Sort individuals based on feasibility rules\\
 Sorted individuals are assigned to possible candidate solutions\\
 First species seed is best candidate solution-remove that solution from candidates\\

  Increment number of species \\
  Store $n$-th candidate solution as seed and remove from list of candidates\\
