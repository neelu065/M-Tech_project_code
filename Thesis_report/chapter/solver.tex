\chapter{CFD Solver}
\label{solver}
\section{Background}
In a recent decade, the capability of computational analysis and optimization has made considerable improvement, which made many researchers rethink solutions to real-world problems. One such problem addressed here is the optimization of wing surface geometry. There requires several software packages and link them using some tools to address these problems. In the entire process of wing shape optimization, the bottleneck is found to be a CFD solution. More importance needs to be given to minimize the time taken by the solver. The SU2 solver is chosen based on its ease of availability and other constraint involved. The solver is initially tested on sample wing shape (NACA 0012 wing) for its reliability, and results seem positive. Also, the SU2 solver is open-source. Hence, more flexibility will be available to tweak the code. In this chapter, more emphasis is given to implement the SU2 solver and Pointwise (meshing software).
