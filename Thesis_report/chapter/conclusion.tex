Inputs for these optimizers will be the constraints, design vectors, along with their own design space. The constraint can be of equality or inequality in nature. $C_l$ $<$ 0.35, semi span $\leq$ 3 units, etc. Moreover, design vectors can be control points representing the Bezier curve (in 2D problem) and FFD (in 3D problem) or could even be a vector comprising AoA, chord at different sections, thickness at a different section as Design variable. The output of these optimizers will be CFD solution (at the intermediate part) followed by optimized design vectors that make up the optimized object (wing, airfoil).
